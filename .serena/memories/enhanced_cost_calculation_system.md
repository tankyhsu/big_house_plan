# Enhanced Cost Calculation System

## Overview
Implemented an enhanced cost calculation system for investment portfolio management that replaces simple weighted average with comprehensive transaction engine supporting complex scenarios.

## Key Components

### 1. Transaction Engine (`backend/domain/txn_engine.py`)
Enhanced `compute_position_after_trade` function that returns 3-tuple: `(new_shares, new_avg_cost, realized_pnl)`

**Supported Actions:**
- `BUY`: Weighted average cost with fee capitalization
- `SELL`: Realized P&L calculation with accurate cost basis tracking
- `DIV`: Cash dividends (no position change)
- `STOCK_DIV`: Stock dividends (adjust shares and cost proportionally)
- `SPLIT`: Stock splits (adjust shares and cost)
- `FEE`: Management fees (reduce cost basis)

**Additional Functions:**
- `compute_position_with_corporate_actions()`: Batch transaction processing
- `calculate_cost_basis_adjustment()`: Special corporate actions (spinoffs, mergers)
- `compute_cash_mirror()`: Mirror cash transactions for non-cash instruments

### 2. Service Layer Integration (`backend/services/txn_svc.py`)
**Refactored Functions:**
- `list_txn()`: Uses txn_engine for realized P&L calculation
- `get_monthly_pnl_stats()`: Uses txn_engine for consistent P&L tracking
- `create_txn()`: Enhanced with realized P&L return value
- Cash mirror handling: Uses txn_engine for position calculations

### 3. Testing (`backend/tests/test_enhanced_cost_calculation.py`)
Comprehensive test suite with 12 test cases covering:
- Basic buy/sell transactions
- Corporate actions (dividends, splits, fees)
- Edge cases (zero positions, negative quantities)
- Multi-transaction sequences
- Cost basis adjustments

## Key Improvements

### 1. Realized P&L Tracking
- Accurate calculation: `(sell_price - avg_cost) * shares_sold - fees`
- Returned in API responses for immediate feedback
- Monthly P&L statistics for performance analysis

### 2. Corporate Actions Support
- Stock dividends: Proportional share increase with cost adjustment
- Stock splits: Share multiplication with proportional cost reduction
- Management fees: Cost basis adjustment
- Spinoffs/mergers: Advanced cost basis allocation

### 3. Code Consistency
- Eliminated duplicate cost calculation logic across service layer
- All calculations use unified `txn_engine` functions
- Consistent precision handling using `round_*` functions

## Usage Examples

### Basic Transaction
```python
new_shares, new_cost, realized_pnl = compute_position_after_trade(
    old_shares=100, old_avg_cost=10.0, 
    action="SELL", qty=50, price=15.0, fee=2.0
)
# Returns: (50, 10.0, 248.0)  # 50 shares left, same cost, 248 profit
```

### Corporate Actions
```python
# 2:1 stock split
new_shares, new_cost, _ = compute_position_after_trade(
    old_shares=100, old_avg_cost=20.0,
    action="SPLIT", qty=2.0, price=0, fee=0
)
# Returns: (200, 10.0, 0.0)  # Double shares, half cost
```

### Batch Processing
```python
transactions = [
    {"action": "BUY", "qty": 100, "price": 10.0, "fee": 5.0},
    {"action": "SELL", "qty": 30, "price": 15.0, "fee": 2.0},
]
final_shares, final_cost, total_pnl = compute_position_with_corporate_actions(
    0, 0, transactions
)
```

## Integration Points
- **API Layer**: Enhanced transaction creation returns realized P&L
- **Dashboard**: Monthly P&L statistics for performance tracking
- **Portfolio Calculation**: Consistent cost basis across all calculations
- **Cash Management**: Unified position handling for cash mirror transactions

## Testing Status
- All 88 project tests passing
- 18 transaction engine specific tests
- No regressions from refactoring
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
